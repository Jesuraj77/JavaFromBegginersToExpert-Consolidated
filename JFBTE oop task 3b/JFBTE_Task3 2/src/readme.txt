) Create an abstract class with the name "Shape" to represent 2D 
geometric shapes. It should have 2 properties dim1, dim2.
include an abstract method "calculateArea()".
Provide 3 sub classes with the names "Rectangle", "Circle" and
"Triangle", each of these should provide implementation for the 
abstract method that calculates area of each shape.
Use Polymorphism and write the main program to test the functionality.
